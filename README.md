## PARCELS

PARCELS (acronym to be decided) is an experimental code aimed at
exploring novel approaches for Lagrangian tracking of virtual
particles in the petascale age.

### Motivation

In the last two decades, Lagrangian tracking of virtual particles has
vastly increased our understanding of ocean dynamics and how currents
move stuff around.

However, we are now facing a situation where our Lagrangian codes
severely lag the next generation of ocean circulation models. These
ocean models are so big and massively parallel, and they produce so
much data, that in a few years we may face a situation where many of
the Lagrangian frameworks cannot be used on the latest data anymore.
