## PARCELS

PARCELS (acronym to be decided) is an experimental prototype code aimed at exploring novel approaches for Lagrangian tracking of virtual ocean particles in the petascale age.

### Motivation

In the last two decades, Lagrangian tracking of virtual particles in Ocean General Circulation Models has vastly increased our understanding of ocean dynamics and how currents move stuff around.

However, we are now facing a situation where our Lagrangian codes severely lag the next generation of these ocean circulation models. These ocean models are so big and massively parallel, and they produce so much data, that in a few years we may face a situation where many of the Lagrangian frameworks cannot be used on the latest data anymore.

In this project, we will scope out and develop a new generic, open-source community prototype code for Lagrangian tracking of water particles through any type of ocean circulation models.
